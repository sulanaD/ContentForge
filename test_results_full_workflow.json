Meta-studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack of reproducibility.\n\n\n== Applications in healthcare systems ==\n\n\n=== Disease diagnosis ===\nAccurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy. Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of mass electronic health records (EHRs). AI can help early prediction, for example, of Alzheimer's disease and dementias, by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments.\nDoctors' decision making could also be supported by AI in urgent situations, for example in the emergency department. Here AI algorithms can help prioritize more serious cases and reduce waiting time. Decision support systems augmented with AI can offer real-time suggestions and faster data interpretation to aid the decisions made by healthcare professionals.\nIn 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates with ChatGPT-generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on Reddit's r/AskDocs. Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship. Moreover, responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information, and some have argued that the experiment was not properly blinded, with the evaluators being coauthors of the study.\nRecent developments in statistical physics, machine learning, and inference algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches. Also, the establishment of large healthcare-related data warehouses of sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models.\n\n\n=== Electronic health records ===\nElectronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians.\nOne application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences. NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details.\nBeyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's ",

This method diverges from traditional approaches by introducing a cost matrix, explicitly specifying the penalties or benefits for each type of prediction error. The inherent difficulty which cost-sensitive machine learning tackles is that minimizing different kinds of classification errors is a multi-objective optimization problem.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nCost-sensitive machine learning optimizes models based on the specific consequences of misclassifications, making it a valuable tool in various applications. It is especially useful in problems with a high imbalance in class distribution and a high imbalance in associated costs\nCost-sensitive machine learning introduces a scalar cost function in order to find one (of multiple) Pareto optimal points in this multi-objective optimization problem (similar to the Weighted sum model)\n\n\n== Cost Matrix ==\nThe cost matrix is a crucial element within cost-sensitive modeling, explicitly defining the costs or benefits associated with different prediction errors in classification tasks. Represented as a table, the matrix aligns true and predicted classes, assigning a cost value to each combination. For instance, in binary classification, it may distinguish costs for false positives and false negatives. The utility of the cost matrix lies in its application to calculate the expected cost or loss. The formula, expressed as a double summation, utilizes joint probabilities:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Expected Loss\n        \n        =\n        \n          ∑\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        P\n        (\n        \n          \n            Actual\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            Predicted\n          \n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        )\n        ⋅\n        \n          \n            Cost\n          \n          \n            \n              \n                Actual\n              \n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n              \n                Predicted\n              \n              \n                j\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{Expected Loss}}=\\sum _{i}\\sum _{j}P({\\text{Actual}}_{i},{\\text{Predicted}}_{j})\\cdot {\\text{Cost}}_{{\\text{Actual}}_{i},{\\text{Predicted}}_{j}}}\n  \n\nHere, \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        (\n        \n          \n            Actual\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            Predicted\n          \n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P({\\text{Actual}}_{i},{\\text{Predicted}}_{j})}\n  \n denotes the joint probability of actual class \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n  and predicted class  \n  \n    \n      \n        j\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle j}\n  \n, providing a nuanced measure that considers both the probabilities and associated costs. This approach allows practitioners to fine-tune models based on the specific consequences of misclassifications, adapting to scenarios where the impact of prediction errors varies across classes.\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n=== Fraud Detection ===\nIn the realm of data science, particularly in finance, cost-sensitive machine learning is applied to fraud detection. By assigning different costs to false positives and false negatives, models can be fine-tuned to minimize the overall financial impact of misclassifications.\n\n\n=== Medical Diagnostics ===\nIn healthcare, cost-sensitive machine learning plays a role in medical diagnostics. The approach allows for customization of models based on the potential harm associated with misdiagnoses, ensuring a more patient-centric application of machine learning algorithms.\n\n\n== Challenges ==\nA typical challenge in cost-sensitive machine learning is the reliable determination of the cost matrix which may evolve over time.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nCost-Sensitive Machine Learning.

It defined sustainable development as meeting \"the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\". This description of sustainable development has since been referenced in many definitions and explanations of sustainable energy. \nThere is no universally accepted interpretation of how the concept of sustainability applies to energy on a global scale. Working definitions of sustainable energy encompass multiple dimensions of sustainability such as environmental, economic, and social dimensions. Historically, the concept of sustainable energy development has focused on emissions and on energy security. Since the early 1990s, the concept has broadened to encompass wider social and economic issues. \nThe environmental dimension of sustainability includes greenhouse gas emissions, impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, hazardous waste and toxic emissions, water consumption, and depletion of non-renewable resources. Energy sources with low environmental impact are sometimes called green energy or clean energy. The economic dimension of sustainability covers economic development, efficient use of energy, and energy security to ensure that each country has constant access to sufficient energy. Social issues include access to affordable and reliable energy for all people, workers' rights, and land rights.\n\n\n=== Environmental impacts ===\n\nThe current en",

Second, the business preserves financial capital through responsible and efficient business models. Third, the company focuses on social responsibility by upholding human rights. Finally, it emphasizes cultural sustainability by supporting inclusion and respect for local and global communities.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe concept of sustainability refers to the ability to meet the needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own. In business, sustainability includes aligning economic growth with environmental protection. It emphasizes practices that minimize ecological damage, such as the reduction of waste and the limitation of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to rising atmospheric CO2 levels.\nThe term sustainable business is related to other concepts such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), coporate citizenship, and responsible business. The triple bottom line, introduced by John Elkington in the 1990s, expands all this idea by evaluating business success across people, planet, and profit dimensions.\nIn contrast, short-termism refers to the prioritizing short-term financial outcome at the expense of long-term interests. Short-termism discourages investment in sustainable initiatives, contributing to source depletion and increased CO2 emissions. Short-termism has become a relevant theme in sustainability discussions, as balancing financial outcomes with environmental and social considerations is a challenge within modern business practices.\nGreen businesses are sometimes considered as possible mediators of economic-environmental relations, even if the business has a minimal effect on lowering atmospheric CO2 levels. The definition of \"green jobs\" is ambiguous. Still, it is generally agreed that these jobs, the result of green business, should be linked to \"clean energy\" and contribute to reducing greenhouse gases. These corporations can be seen as generators of not only \"green energy\" but as producers of new \"materializes\" that are the product of the technologies these firms developed and deployed.\n\n\n== Environmental sphere ==\nA major initiative of sustainable businesses is to eliminate or decrease the environmental harm caused by the production and consumption of their goods. The impact of such human activities in terms of the number of greenhouse gases produced can be measured in units of carbon dioxide and is referred to as the carbon footprint. The carbon footprint concept is derived from the ecological footprint analysis, which examines the ecological capacity required to support the consumption of products.\nBusinesses can adopt a wide range of green initiatives:  Tao et al. refer to a variety of \"green\" business practices including green strategy, green design, green production and green operation. One of the most common examples of a \"green\" business practice is the act of \"going paperless\" or sending electronic correspondence in instead of paper when possible. On a higher level, examples of sustainable business practices include: refurbishing used products (e.g., tuning up lightly used commercial fitness equipment for resale); revising production processes to eliminate waste (such as using a more accurate template to cut out designs), and choosing nontoxic raw materials and processes. For example, Canadian farmers have found that hemp is a sustainable alternative to rapeseed in their traditional crop rotation; hemp grown for fiber or seed requires no pesticides or herbicides. Another example is upcycling clothes or textiles, in which businesses can upcycle products to maintain or increase their quality.\nSustainable business leaders also take into account the life cycle costs for the items they produce. Input costs must be considered regarding regulations, energy use, storage, and disposal. Designing for the environment (DFE) is also an element of sustainable business. This process enables users to consider the potential environmental impacts of a product and the process used to make that product.\nThe many possibilities for adopting green practices have led to considerable pressure being put upon companies from consumers, employees, government regulators, and other stakeholders. Some companies have resorted to \"greenwashing\" instead of making meaningful changes, merely marketing their produc",

The SDGs highlight the connections between the environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainable development.

They come close to prescriptive international norms but are generally more specific, and they can be highly ambitious. The overarching UN program \"2030 Agenda\" presented the SDGs in 2015 as a \"supremely ambitious and transformative vision\" that should be accompanied by \"bold and transformative steps\" with \"scale and ambition\".\nThe SDGs apply to all countries of the world, not just developing countries like the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) did (from the year 2000 to 2015). They target all three dimensions of sustainability and sustainable development, namely the environmental, economic and social dimension. Another aspect that makes the SDGs different to the MDGs is that the development and negotiations of the SDGs were not \"top down\" by civil servants but were relatively open and transparent, aiming to include \"bottom up\" participation.\nThe SDGs are emphasizing inclusiveness in the national context and also in global governance. For the national context this means a focus on marginalised groups that are affected by exclusion and inequalities. For the global context, inclusiveness means a special emphasis on the least developed countries.\nAt the heart of the SDGs lies the pledge of the United Nations Member States to Leave No One Behind (abbreviated as LNOB). In other words: to reach the people and countries who are furthest behind first. The LNOB concept is a politically and technically challenging approach that is ambiguous and open to interpretation. A study from 2024 investigated 77 voluntary national reviews and found that people with disabilities are most often identified as furthest behind (>70%), followed by women and girls (>60%), youth (ca. 50%), elderly (45%), children (>40%), and refugees and migrants (ca. 30%).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\n=== Goals and targets ===\nThe lists of 169 targets and indicators for the 17 SDGs was published in a UN resolution in July 2017.
